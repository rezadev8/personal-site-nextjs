    "desc": "Since childhood, I have been passionate about various technologies, and I demonstrated this passion by tinkering with and sometimes breaking different phones and computers.\n When I turned 15, I decided to step into the world of technology and become more familiar with it. Python was the first language I used to write my own 'Hello, world!' program. I chose Python because I am enamored with artificial intelligence, and Python seemed like the perfect fit for this interest. I started with the basics of Python, but after a while, I decided to venture into web development and began learning HTML5 and CSS3.\nFrom a professional standpoint, I began learning web development around the age of 16 and as I delved deeper into it, my passion for my work grew. After learning JavaScript, I started exploring various JavaScript libraries and frameworks, which led me to become proficient in both frontend and backend development. Currently, I am actively engaged in both areas professionally, and I continue to learn and stay up-to-date with various technologies every day.",
